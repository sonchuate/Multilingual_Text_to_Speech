12575|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0272.wav|||Chief Rowley testified|
12576|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0273.wav|||that under ordinary circumstances he would have taken disciplinary action against those agents who had been drinking in clear violation of the regulation.|
12577|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0274.wav|||However, he felt that any disciplinary action might have given rise|
12578|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0275.wav|||to an inference that the violation of the regulation had contributed to the tragic events of November twenty-two.|
12579|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0276.wav|||Since he was convinced that this was not the case, he believed that it would be unfair to the agents and their families to take explicit disciplinary measures.|
12580|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0277.wav|||He felt that each agent recognized the seriousness of the infraction and that there was no danger of a repetition.|
12581|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0278.wav|||The Commission recognizes that the responsibilities of members of the White House detail of the Secret Service are arduous.|
12582|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0279.wav|||They work long, hard hours, under very great strain, and must travel frequently.|
12583|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0280.wav|||It might seem harsh to circumscribe their opportunities for relaxation.|
12584|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0281.wav|||Yet their role of protecting the President is so important to the well-being of the country|
12585|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0282.wav|||that it is reasonable to expect them to meet very high standards of personal conduct,|
12586|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0283.wav|||so that nothing can interfere with their bringing to their task the finest qualities and maximum resources of mind and body.|
12587|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0284.wav|||This is the salutary goal to which the Secret Service regulation is directed,|
12588|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0285.wav|||when it absolutely forbids drinking by any agent accompanying the President on a trip.|
12589|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0286.wav|||Nor is this goal served when agents remain out until early morning hours, and lose the opportunity to get a reasonable amount of sleep.|
12590|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0287.wav|||It is conceivable that those men who had little sleep, and who had consumed alcoholic beverages, even in limited quantities,|
12591|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0288.wav|||might have been more alert in the Dallas motorcade if they had retired promptly in Fort Worth.|
12592|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0289.wav|||However, there is no evidence that these men failed to take any action in Dallas within their power that would have averted the tragedy.|

12596|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0004.wav|||The motorcade in Dallas.|
12597|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0005.wav|||Rigorous security precautions had been arranged at Love Field with the local law enforcement authorities by Agents Sorrels and Lawson.|
12598|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0006.wav|||These precautions included reserving a ceremonial area for the Presidential party,|
12599|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0007.wav|||stationing police on the rooftops of all buildings overlooking the reception area,|
12600|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0008.wav|||and detailing police in civilian clothes to be scattered throughout the sizable crowd.|
12601|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0009.wav|||When President and Mrs. Kennedy shook hands with members of the public along the fences surrounding the reception area, they were closely guarded by Secret Service agents|
12602|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0010.wav|||who responded to the unplanned event with dispatch.|
12603|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0011.wav|||As described in chapter two, the President directed that his car stop on two occasions during the motorcade so that he could greet members of the public.|
12604|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0012.wav|||At these stops, agents from the Presidential follow-up car stood between the President and the public,|
12605|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0013.wav|||and on one occasion Agent Kellerman left the front seat of the President's car to take a similar position.|
12606|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0014.wav|||The Commission regards such impromptu stops as presenting an unnecessary danger,|
12607|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0015.wav|||but finds that the Secret Service agents did all that could have been done to take protective measures.|
12608|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0016.wav|||The Presidential limousine.|
12609|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0017.wav|||The limousine used by President Kennedy in Dallas was a convertible with a detachable, rigid plastic "bubble" top|
12610|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0018.wav|||which was neither bulletproof nor bullet resistant.|
12611|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0019.wav|||The last Presidential vehicle with any protection against small-arms fire left the White House in nineteen fifty-three.|
12612|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0020.wav|||It was not then replaced because the state of the art did not permit the development of a bulletproof top of sufficiently light weight|
12613|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0021.wav|||to permit its removal on those occasions when the President wished to ride in an open car.|
12614|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0022.wav|||The Secret Service believed that it was very doubtful that any President would ride regularly in a vehicle with a fixed top, even though transparent.|
12615|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0023.wav|||Since the assassination, the Secret Service, with the assistance of other Federal agencies and of private industry,|
12616|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0024.wav|||has developed a vehicle for the better protection of the President.|
12617|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0025.wav|||Access to passenger compartment of Presidential car.|
12618|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0026.wav|||On occasion the Secret Service has been permitted to have an agent riding in the passenger compartment with the President.|
12619|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0027.wav|||Presidents have made it clear, however, that they did not favor this or any other arrangement which interferes with the privacy of the President and his guests.|
12620|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0028.wav|||The Secret Service has therefore suggested this practice only on extraordinary occasions.|
12621|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0029.wav|||Without attempting to prescribe or recommend specific measures which should be employed for the future protection of Presidents,|
12622|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0030.wav|||the Commission does believe that there are aspects of the protective measures employed in the motorcade at Dallas which deserve special comment.|
12623|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0031.wav|||The Presidential vehicle in use in Dallas, described in chapter two,|
12624|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0032.wav|||had no special design or equipment which would have permitted the Secret Service agent riding in the driver's compartment|
12625|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0033.wav|||to move into the passenger section without hindrance or delay. Had the vehicle been so designed it is possible that an agent riding in the front seat|
12626|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0034.wav|||could have reached the President in time to protect him from the second and fatal shot to hit the President.|
12627|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0035.wav|||However, such access to the President was interfered with both by the metal bar some fifteen inches above the back of the front seat|
12628|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0036.wav|||and by the passengers in the jump seats.|
12629|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0037.wav|||In contrast, the Vice Presidential vehicle, although not specially designed for that purpose,|
12630|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0038.wav|||had no passenger in a jump seat between Agent Youngblood and Vice President Johnson to interfere with Agent Youngblood's ability|
12631|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0039.wav|||to take a protective position in the passenger compartment before the third shot was fired.|
12632|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0040.wav|||The assassination suggests that it would have been of prime importance|
12633|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0041.wav|||in the protection of the President if the Presidential car permitted immediate access to the President by a Secret Service agent at the first sign of danger.|
12634|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0042.wav|||At that time the agents on the framing boards of the follow-up car were expected to perform such a function.|
12635|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0043.wav|||However, these agents could not reach the President's car when it was traveling at an appreciable rate of speed.|
12636|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0044.wav|||Even if the car is traveling more slowly, the delay involved in reaching the President may be crucial.|
12637|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0045.wav|||It is clear that at the time of the shots in Dallas, Agent Clinton J. Hill leaped to the President's rescue as quickly as humanly possible.|
12638|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0046.wav|||Even so, analysis of the motion picture films taken by amateur photographer Zapruder|
12639|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0047.wav|||reveals that Hill first placed his hand on the Presidential car at frame three forty-three, thirty frames|
12640|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0048.wav|||and therefore approximately one point six seconds after the President was shot in the head.|
12641|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0049.wav|||About three point seven seconds after the President received this wound,|
12642|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0050.wav|||Hill had both feet on the car and was climbing aboard to assist President and Mrs. Kennedy.|
12643|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0051.wav|||Planning for motorcade contingencies.|
12644|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0052.wav|||In response to inquiry by the Commission regarding the instructions to agents in a motorcade|
12645|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0053.wav|||of emergency procedures to be taken in a contingency such as that which actually occurred, the Secret Service responded, quote,|
12646|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0054.wav|||The Secret Service has consistently followed two general principles in emergencies involving the President.|
12647|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0055.wav|||All agents are so instructed.|
12648|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0056.wav|||The first duty of the agents in the motorcade is to attempt to cover the President as closely as possible and practicable|
12649|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0057.wav|||and to shield him by attempting to place themselves between the President and any source of danger.|
12650|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0058.wav|||Secondly, agents are instructed to remove the President as quickly as possible from known or impending danger.|
12651|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0059.wav|||Agents are instructed that it is not their responsibility to investigate or evaluate a present danger,|
12652|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0060.wav|||but to consider any untoward circumstances as serious and to afford the President maximum protection at all times.|
12653|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0061.wav|||No responsibility rests upon those agents near the President for the identification or arrest of any assassin or an attacker.|
12654|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0062.wav|||Their primary responsibility is to stay with and protect the President.|
12655|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0063.wav|||Beyond these two principles the Secret Service believes a detailed contingency or emergency plan is not feasible|
12656|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0064.wav|||because the variations possible preclude effective planning.|
12657|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0065.wav|||A number of steps are taken, however, to permit appropriate steps to be taken in an emergency.|
12658|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0066.wav|||For instance, the lead car always is manned by Secret Service agents familiar with the area and with local law enforcement officials;|
12659|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0067.wav|||the radio net in use in motorcades is elaborate and permits a number of different means of communication with various local points.|
12660|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0068.wav|||A doctor is in the motorcade.|
12661|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0069.wav|||This basic approach to the problem of planning for emergencies is sound.|
12662|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0070.wav|||Any effort to prepare detailed contingency plans might well have the undesirable effect of inhibiting quick and imaginative responses.|
12663|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0071.wav|||If the advance preparation is thorough, and the protective devices and techniques employed are sound,|
12664|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0072.wav|||those in command should be able to direct the response appropriate to the emergency. The Commission finds that the Secret Service agents in the motorcade|
12665|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0073.wav|||who were immediately responsible for the President's safety reacted promptly at the time the shots were fired.|
12666|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0074.wav|||Their actions demonstrate that the President and the Nation can expect courage and devotion to duty from the agents of the Secret Service.|
12667|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0075.wav|||Recommendations.|
12668|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0076.wav|||The Commission's review of the provisions for Presidential protection at the time of President Kennedy's trip to Dallas demonstrates the need for substantial improvements.|
12669|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0077.wav|||Since the assassination, the Secret Service and the Department of the Treasury|
12670|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0078.wav|||have properly taken the initiative in reexamining major aspects of Presidential protection.|
12671|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0079.wav|||Many changes have already been made and others are contemplated, some of them in response to the Commission's questions and informal suggestions.|
12672|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0080.wav|||Assassination a Federal Crime|
12673|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0081.wav|||There was no Federal criminal jurisdiction over the assassination of President Kennedy.|
12674|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0082.wav|||Had there been reason to believe that the assassination was the result of a conspiracy, Federal jurisdiction could have been asserted;|
12675|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0083.wav|||it has long been a Federal crime to conspire to injure any Federal officer, on account of, or while he is engaged in, the lawful discharge of the duties of his office.|
12676|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0084.wav|||Murder of the President has never been covered by Federal law, however, so that once it became reasonably clear that the killing was the act of a single person,|
12677|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0085.wav|||the State of Texas had exclusive jurisdiction.|
12678|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0086.wav|||It is anomalous that Congress has legislated in other ways touching upon the safety of the Chief Executive or other Federal officers,|
12679|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0087.wav|||without making an attack on the President a crime. Threatening harm to the President is a Federal offense,|
12680|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0088.wav|||as is advocacy of the overthrow of the Government by the assassination of any of its officers.|
12681|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0089.wav|||The murder of Federal judges, U.S. attorneys and marshals, and a number of other specifically designated|
12682|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0090.wav|||Federal law enforcement officers is a Federal crime.|
12683|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0091.wav|||Equally anomalous are statutory provisions which specifically authorize the Secret Service to protect the President,|
12684|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0092.wav|||without authorizing it to arrest anyone who harms him. The same provisions authorize the Service to arrest without warrant|
12685|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0093.wav|||persons committing certain offenses, including counterfeiting and certain frauds involving Federal checks or securities.|
12686|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0094.wav|||The Commission agrees with the Secret Service that it should be authorized to make arrests without warrant|
12687|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0095.wav|||for all offenses within its jurisdiction, as are FBI agents and Federal marshals.|
12688|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0096.wav|||There have been a number of efforts to make assassination a Federal crime, particularly after the assassination of President McKinley|
12689|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0097.wav|||and the attempt on the life of President-elect Franklin D. Roosevelt.|
12690|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0098.wav|||In nineteen oh two bills passed both Houses of Congress but failed of enactment when the Senate refused to accept the conference report.|
12691|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0099.wav|||A number of bills were introduced immediately following the assassination of President Kennedy.|
12692|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0100.wav|||The Commission recommends to the Congress that it adopt legislation which would:|
12693|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0101.wav|||Punish the murder or manslaughter of, attempt or conspiracy to murder, kidnaping of and assault upon|
12694|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0102.wav|||the President, Vice President, or other officer next in the order of succession to the Office of President, the President-elect and the Vice-President-elect,|
12695|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0103.wav|||whether or not the act is committed while the victim is in the performance of his official duties or on account of such performance.|
12696|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0104.wav|||Such a statute would cover the President and Vice President or, in the absence of a Vice President, the person next in order of succession.|
12697|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0105.wav|||During the period between election and inauguration, the President-elect and Vice-President-elect would also be covered.|
12698|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0106.wav|||Restricting the coverage in this way would avoid unnecessary controversy over the inclusion or exclusion of other officials who are in the order of succession|
12699|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0107.wav|||or who hold important governmental posts.|
12700|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0108.wav|||In addition, the restriction would probably eliminate a need for the requirement which has been urged as necessary for the exercise of Federal power,|
12701|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0109.wav|||that the hostile act occur while the victim is engaged in or because of the performance of official duties.|
12702|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0110.wav|||The governmental consequences of assassination of one of the specified officials give the United States ample power to act for its own protection.|
12703|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0111.wav|||The activities of the victim at the time an assassination occurs and the motive for the assassination|
12704|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0112.wav|||bear no relationship to the injury to the United States which follows from the act.|
12705|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0113.wav|||This point was ably made in the nineteen oh two debate by Senator George F. Hoar, the sponsor of the Senate bill, quote,|
12706|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0114.wav|||what this bill means to punish is the crime of interruption of the Government of the United States and the destruction of its security by striking down the life|
12707|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0115.wav|||of the person who is actually in the exercise of the executive power, or|
12708|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0116.wav|||of such persons as have been constitutionally and lawfully provided to succeed thereto in case of a vacancy. It is important to this country|

12710|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0118.wav|||Enactment of this statute would mean that the investigation of any of the acts covered and of the possibility of a further attempt|
12711|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0119.wav|||would be conducted by Federal law enforcement officials, in particular, the FBI with the assistance of the Secret Service.|
12712|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0120.wav|||At present, Federal agencies participate only upon the sufferance of the local authorities.|
12713|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0121.wav|||While the police work of the Dallas authorities in the early identification and apprehension of Oswald was both efficient and prompt,|
12714|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0122.wav|||FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, who strongly supports such legislation, testified that the absence of clear Federal jurisdiction|
12715|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0123.wav|||over the assassination of President Kennedy led to embarrassment and confusion in the subsequent investigation by Federal and local authorities.|
12716|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0124.wav|||In addition, the proposed legislation will insure|
12717|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0125.wav|||that any suspects who are arrested will be Federal prisoners, subject to Federal protection from vigilante justice and other threats.|

12723|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0132.wav|||The Commission believes that it is necessary to improve the cooperation among these agencies|
12724|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0133.wav|||and to emphasize that the task of Presidential protection is one of broad national concern.|
12725|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0134.wav|||The Commission suggests that consideration might be given to assigning to a Cabinet-level committee or the National Security Council|
12726|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0135.wav|||(which is responsible for advising the President respecting the coordination|
12727|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0136.wav|||of departmental policies relating to the national security) the responsibility to review and oversee the protective activities of the Secret Service|
12728|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0137.wav|||and the other Federal agencies that assist in safeguarding the President. The Committee should include the Secretary of the Treasury and the Attorney General,|
12729|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0138.wav|||and, if the Council is used, arrangements should be made for the attendance of the Secretary of the Treasury|
12730|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0139.wav|||and the Attorney General at any meetings which are concerned with Presidential protection.|
12731|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0140.wav|||The Council already includes, in addition to the President and Vice President, the Secretaries of State and Defense and has a competent staff.|
12732|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0141.wav|||The foremost assignment of the Committee would be to insure that the maximum resources of the Federal Government are fully engaged in the job of protecting the President,|
12733|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0142.wav|||by defining responsibilities clearly and overseeing their execution.|
12734|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0143.wav|||Major needs of personnel or other resources might be met more easily on its recommendation than they have been in the past.|
12735|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0144.wav|||The Committee would be able to provide guidance in defining the general nature of domestic and foreign dangers to Presidential security.|
12736|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0145.wav|||As improvements are recommended for the advance detection of potential threats to the President, it could act as a final review board.|
12737|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0146.wav|||The expert assistance and resources which it could draw upon would be particularly desirable in this complex and sensitive area.|
12738|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0147.wav|||This arrangement would provide a continuing high-level contact for agencies that may wish to consult respecting particular protective measures.|
12739|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0148.wav|||For various reasons the Secret Service has functioned largely as an informal part of the White House staff, with the result|
12740|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0149.wav|||that it has been unable, as a practical matter, to exercise sufficient influence over the security precautions which surround Presidential activities.|
12741|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0150.wav|||A Cabinet-level committee which is actively concerned with these problems would be able to discuss these matters more effectively with the President.|
12742|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0151.wav|||Responsibilities for Presidential Protection|
12743|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0152.wav|||The assignment of the responsibility of protecting the President to an agency of the Department of the Treasury was largely an historical accident.|
12744|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0153.wav|||The Secret Service was organized as a division of the Department of the Treasury in eighteen sixty-five, to deal with counterfeiting.|
12745|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0154.wav|||In eighteen ninety-four,|
12746|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0155.wav|||while investigating a plot to assassinate President Cleveland, the Service assigned a small protective detail of agents to the White House.|
12747|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0156.wav|||Secret Service men accompanied the President and his family to their vacation home in Massachusetts|
12748|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0157.wav|||and special details protected him in Washington, on trips, and at special functions.|
12749|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0158.wav|||These informal and part-time arrangements led to more systematic protection in nineteen oh two, after the assassination of President McKinley;|
12750|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0159.wav|||the Secret Service, then the only Federal investigative agency, assumed full-time responsibility for the safety of the President.|
12751|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0160.wav|||Since that time, the Secret Service has had and exercised responsibility for the physical protection of the President|
12752|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0161.wav|||and also for the preventive investigation of potential threats against the President.|
12753|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0162.wav|||Although the Secret Service has had the primary responsibility for the protection of the President,|
12754|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0163.wav|||the FBI, which was established within the Department of Justice in nineteen oh eight, has had in recent years an increasingly important role to play.|
12755|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0164.wav|||In the appropriations of the FBI there has recurred annually an item for the, quote, protection of the person of the President of the United States, end quote,|
12756|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0165.wav|||which first appeared in the appropriation of the Department of Justice in nineteen ten under the heading, quote, Miscellaneous Objects, end quote.|
12757|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0166.wav|||Although the FBI is not charged with the physical protection of the President, it does have an assignment, as do other Government agencies,|
12758|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0167.wav|||in the field of preventive investigation in regard to the President's security.|
12759|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0168.wav|||As discussed above, the Bureau has attempted to meet its responsibilities in this field by spelling out in its Handbook|
12760|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0169.wav|||the procedures which its agents are to follow in connection with information received, quote,|
12761|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0170.wav|||indicating the possibility of an attempt against the person or safety of the President, end quote, or other protected persons.|
12762|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0171.wav|||With two Federal agencies operating in the same general field of preventive investigation,|
12763|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0172.wav|||questions inevitably arise as to the scope of each agency's authority and responsibility.|
12764|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0173.wav|||As the testimony of J. Edgar Hoover and other Bureau officials revealed, the FBI did not believe that its directive required the Bureau|
12765|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0174.wav|||to notify the Secret Service of the substantial information about Lee Harvey Oswald which the FBI had accumulated|
12766|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0175.wav|||before the President reached Dallas.|
12767|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0176.wav|||On the other hand, the Secret Service had no knowledge whatever of Oswald, his background, or his employment at the Book Depository,|
12768|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0177.wav|||and Robert I. Bouck, who was in charge of the Protective Research Section of the Secret Service, believed that the accumulation of the facts known to the FBI|
12769|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0178.wav|||should have constituted a sufficient basis to warn the Secret Service of the Oswald risk.|
12770|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0179.wav|||The Commission believes that both the FBI and the Secret Service have too narrowly construed their respective responsibilities.|
12771|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0180.wav|||The Commission has the impression|
12772|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0181.wav|||that too much emphasis is placed by both on the investigation of specific threats by individuals and not enough on dangers from other sources.|
12773|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0182.wav|||In addition, the Commission has concluded that the Secret Service particularly tends to be the passive recipient of information|
12774|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0183.wav|||regarding such threats and that its Protective Research Section is not adequately staffed or equipped|
12775|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0184.wav|||to conduct the wider investigative work that is required today for the security of the President.|
12776|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0185.wav|||During the period the Commission was giving thought to this situation,|
12777|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0186.wav|||the Commission received a number of proposals designed to improve current arrangements for protecting the President.|
12778|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0187.wav|||These proposals included suggestions to locate exclusive responsibility for all phases of the work|
12779|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0188.wav|||in one or another Government agency, to clarify the division of authority between the agencies involved, and to retain the existing system|
12780|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0189.wav|||but expand both the scope and the operations of the existing agencies, particularly those of the Secret Service and the FBI.|
12781|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0190.wav|||It has been pointed out that the FBI, as our chief investigative agency,|
12782|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0191.wav|||is properly manned and equipped to carry on extensive information gathering functions within the United States.|
12783|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0192.wav|||It was also suggested that it would take a substantial period of time for the Secret Service to build up the experience and skills necessary to meet the problem.|
12784|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0193.wav|||Consequently the suggestion has been made, on the one hand, that all preventive investigative functions relating to the security of the President|
12785|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0194.wav|||should be transferred to the FBI,|
12786|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0195.wav|||leaving with the Secret Service only the responsibility for the physical protection of the President, that is, the guarding function alone.|
12787|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0196.wav|||On the other hand, it is urged that all features of the protection of the President and his family should be committed to an elite and independent corps.|
12788|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0197.wav|||It is also contended that the agents should be intimately associated with the life of the Presidential family|
12789|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0198.wav|||in all its ramifications and alert to every danger that might befall it,|
12790|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0199.wav|||and ready at any instant to hazard great danger to themselves in the performance of their tremendous responsibility.|
12791|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0200.wav|||It is suggested that an organization shorn of its power to investigate all the possibilities of danger to the President|
12792|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0201.wav|||and becoming merely the recipient of information gathered by others would become limited solely to acts of physical alertness and personal courage|
12793|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0202.wav|||incident to its responsibilities.|
12794|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0203.wav|||So circumscribed, it could not maintain the esprit de corps or the necessary alertness for this unique and challenging responsibility.|
12795|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0204.wav|||While in accordance with its mandate|
12796|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0205.wav|||this Commission has necessarily examined into the functioning of the various Federal agencies concerned with the tragic trip of President Kennedy to Dallas|
12797|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0206.wav|||and while it has arrived at certain conclusions in respect thereto, it seems clear|
12798|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0207.wav|||that it was not within the Commission's responsibility to make specific recommendations as to the long-range organization of the President's protection,|
12799|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0208.wav|||except as conclusions flowing directly from its examination of the President's assassination can be drawn.|
12800|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0209.wav|||The Commission was not asked to apply itself as did the Hoover Commission in nineteen forty-nine,|
12801|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0210.wav|||for examples to a determination of the optimum organization of the President's protection.|
12802|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0211.wav|||It would have been necessary for the Commission to take considerable testimony, much of it extraneous to the facts of the assassination of President Kennedy,|
12803|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0212.wav|||to put it in a position to reach final conclusions in this respect.|
12804|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0213.wav|||There are always dangers of divided responsibility,|
12805|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0214.wav|||duplication, and confusion of authority where more than one agency is operating in the same field; but on the other hand|
12806|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0215.wav|||the protection of the President is in a real sense a Government-wide responsibility which must necessarily assumed by the Department of State,|
12807|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0216.wav|||the FBI, the CIA, and the military intelligence agencies as well as the Secret Service.|
12808|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0217.wav|||Moreover, a number of imponderable questions have to be weighed if any change in the intimate association now established|
12809|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0218.wav|||between the Secret Service and the President and his family is contemplated.|
12810|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0219.wav|||These considerations have induced the Commission to believe|
12811|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0220.wav|||that the determination of whether or not there should be a relocation of responsibilities and functions should be left to the Executive and the Congress,|
12812|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0221.wav|||perhaps upon recommendations based on further studies by the Cabinet-level committee recommended above or the National Security Council.|
12813|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0222.wav|||Pending any such determination, however, this Commission is convinced of the necessity of better coordination|
12814|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0223.wav|||and direction of the activities of all existing agencies of Government which are in a position to and do, furnish information|
12815|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0224.wav|||and services related to the security of the President.|
12816|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0225.wav|||The Commission feels the Secret Service and the FBI, as well as the State Department and the CIA when the President travels abroad,|
12817|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0226.wav|||could improve their existing capacities and procedures so as to lessen the chances of assassination.|
12818|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0227.wav|||Without, therefore, coming to final conclusions respecting the long-range organization of the President's security,|
12819|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0228.wav|||the Commission believes that the facts of the assassination of President Kennedy point to certain measures which,|
12820|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0229.wav|||while assuming no radical relocation of responsibilities,|
12821|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0230.wav|||can and should be recommended by this Commission in the interest of the more efficient protection of the President.|

12826|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0005.wav|||The intimacy of the Secret Service's relationship to the White House|
12827|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0006.wav|||and the dissimilarity of its protective functions to most activities of the Department of the Treasury|
12828|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0007.wav|||have made it difficult for the Treasury to maintain close and continuing supervision.|
12829|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0008.wav|||The Commission believes that the recommended Cabinet-level committee will help to correct many of the major deficiencies of supervision|
12830|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0009.wav|||disclosed by the Commission's investigation. Other measures should be taken as well to improve the overall operation of the Secret Service.|
12831|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0010.wav|||Daily supervision of the operations of the Secret Service within the Department of the Treasury should be improved.|
12832|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0011.wav|||The Chief of the Service now reports to the Secretary of the Treasury|
12833|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0012.wav|||through an Assistant Secretary whose duties also include the direct supervision of the Bureau of the Mint|

12836|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0015.wav|||The Commission recommends that the Secretary of the Treasury appoint a special assistant with the responsibility of supervising the Service.|
12837|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0016.wav|||This special assistant should be required to have sufficient stature and experience in law enforcement, intelligence, or allied fields|
12838|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0017.wav|||to be able to provide effective continuing supervision|
12839|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0018.wav|||and to keep the Secretary fully informed regarding all significant developments relating to Presidential protection.|
12840|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0019.wav|||This report has already pointed out several respects|
12841|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0020.wav|||in which the Commission believes that the Secret Service has operated with insufficient planning or control.|
12842|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0021.wav|||Actions by the Service since the assassination indicate its awareness of the necessity for substantial improvement in its administration.|
12843|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0022.wav|||A formal and thorough description of the responsibilities of the advance agent is now in preparation by the Service.|
12844|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0023.wav|||Work is going forward|
12845|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0024.wav|||toward the preparation of formal understandings of the respective roles of the Secret Service and other agencies with which it collaborates|
12846|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0025.wav|||or from which it derives assistance and support.|
12847|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0026.wav|||The Commission urges that the Service continue this effort to overhaul and define its procedures.|
12848|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0027.wav|||While manuals and memoranda are no guarantee of effective operations,|
12849|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0028.wav|||no sizable organization can achieve efficiency without the careful analysis and demarcation of responsibility|
12850|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0029.wav|||that is reflected in definite and comprehensive operating procedures.|
12851|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0030.wav|||The Commission also recommends|
12852|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0031.wav|||that the Secret Service consciously set about the task of inculcating and maintaining the highest standard of excellence and esprit, for all of its personnel.|
12853|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0032.wav|||This involves tight and unswerving discipline as well as the promotion of an outstanding degree of dedication and loyalty to duty.|
12854|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0033.wav|||The Commission emphasizes that it finds no causal connection between the assassination|
12855|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0034.wav|||and the breach of regulations which occurred on the night of November twenty-one at Fort Worth.|
12856|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0035.wav|||Nevertheless, such a breach, in which so many agents participated,|
12857|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0036.wav|||is not consistent with the standards which the responsibilities of the Secret Service require it to meet.|
12858|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0037.wav|||Preventive Intelligence|
12859|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0038.wav|||In attempting to identify those individuals who might prove a danger to the President,|
12860|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0039.wav|||the Secret Service has largely been the passive recipient of threatening communications to the President|
12861|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0040.wav|||and reports from other agencies which independently evaluate their information for potential sources of danger.|
12862|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0041.wav|||This was the consequence of the Service's lack of an adequate investigative staff,|
12863|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0042.wav|||its inability to process large amounts of data, and its failure to provide specific descriptions of the kind of information it sought.|
12864|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0043.wav|||The Secret Service has embarked upon a complete overhaul of its research activities. The staff of the Protective Research Section (PRS)|
12865|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0044.wav|||has been augmented, and a Secret Service inspector has been put in charge of this operation. With the assistance of the President's Office of Science and Technology,|
12866|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0045.wav|||and of the Advanced Research Projects Agency of the Department of Defense,|
12867|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0046.wav|||it has obtained the services of outside consultants, such as the Rand Corporation,|

12869|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0048.wav|||It has received assistance also from data processing experts at the CIA|
12870|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0049.wav|||and from a specialist in psychiatric prognostication at Walter Reed Hospital.|
12871|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0050.wav|||As a result of these studies, the planning document submitted by the Secretary of the Treasury to the Bureau of the Budget on August thirty-one,|
12872|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0051.wav|||nineteen sixty-four, makes several significant recommendations in this field.|
12873|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0052.wav|||Based on the Commission's investigation, the following minimum goals for improvements are indicated:|
12874|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0053.wav|||Broader and more selective criteria|
12875|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0054.wav|||Since the assassination, both the Secret Service and the FBI have recognized|
12876|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0055.wav|||that the PRS files can no longer be limited largely to persons communicating actual threats to the President.|
12877|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0056.wav|||On December twenty-six, nineteen sixty-three, the FBI circulated additional instructions to all its agents,|
12878|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0057.wav|||specifying criteria for information to be furnished to the Secret Service in addition to that covered by the former standard,|
12879|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0058.wav|||which was the possibility of an attempt against the person or safety of the President.|
12880|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0059.wav|||he new instructions require FBI agents to report immediately information concerning, quote,|
12881|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0060.wav|||Subversives, ultrarightists, racists and fascists (a) possessing emotional instability or irrational behavior,|
12882|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0061.wav|||(b) who have made threats of bodily harm against officials or employees of Federal, state or local government or officials of a foreign government,|
12883|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0062.wav|||(c) who express or have expressed strong or violent anti-U.S. sentiments|
12884|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0063.wav|||and who have been involved in bombing or bomb-making or whose past conduct indicates tendencies toward violence, and (d)|
12885|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0064.wav|||whose prior acts or statements depict propensity for violence and hatred against organized government, end quote.|
12886|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0065.wav|||Alan H. Belmont, Assistant to the Director of the FBI, testified that this revision was initiated by the FBI itself.|
12887|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0066.wav|||The volume of references to the Secret Service has increased substantially since the new instructions went into effect;|
12888|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0067.wav|||more than five thousand names were referred to the Secret Service in the first four months of nineteen sixty-four.|
12889|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0068.wav|||According to Chief Rowley, by mid-June nineteen sixty-four,|
12890|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0069.wav|||the Secret Service had received from the FBI some nine thousand reports on members of the Communist Party.|
12891|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0070.wav|||The FBI now transmits information on all defectors, a category which would, of course, have included Oswald.|
12892|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0071.wav|||Both Director Hoover and Belmont expressed to the Commission the great concern of the FBI, which is shared by the Secret Service,|
12893|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0072.wav|||that referrals to the Secret Service under the new criteria might, if not properly handled,|
12894|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0073.wav|||result in some degree of interference with the personal liberty of those involved.|
12895|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0074.wav|||They emphasized the necessity that the information now being furnished be handled with judgment and care.|
12896|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0075.wav|||The Commission shares this concern.|
12897|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0076.wav|||The problem is aggravated by the necessity that the Service obtain the assistance of local law enforcement officials in evaluating the information which it receives|
12898|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0077.wav|||and in taking preventive steps.|
12899|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0078.wav|||In June nineteen sixty-four, the Secret Service sent to a number of Federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies|
12900|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0079.wav|||guidelines for an experimental program to develop more detailed criteria.|
12901|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0080.wav|||The suggestions of Federal agencies for revision of these guidelines were solicited.|
12902|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0081.wav|||The new tentative criteria are useful in making clear that|
12903|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0082.wav|||the interest of the Secret Service goes beyond information on individuals or groups threatening to cause harm or embarrassment to the President.|
12904|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0083.wav|||Information is requested also concerning individuals or groups who have demonstrated an interest in the President|
12905|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0084.wav|||or, quote, other high government officials in the nature of a complaint coupled with an expressed or implied determination to use a means,|
12906|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0085.wav|||other than legal or peaceful, to satisfy any grievance, real or imagined.|
12907|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0086.wav|||Under these criteria, whether the case should be referred to the Secret Service depends on the existence of a previous history of mental instability,|
12908|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0087.wav|||propensity toward violent action, or some similar characteristic, coupled with some evaluation of the capability of the individual or group|
12909|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0088.wav|||to further the intention to satisfy a grievance by unlawful means.|
12910|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0089.wav|||While these tentative criteria are a step in the right direction,|
12911|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0090.wav|||they seem unduly restrictive in continuing to require some manifestation of animus against a Government official.|
12912|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0091.wav|||It is questionable whether such criteria would have resulted in the referral of Oswald to the Secret Service.|
12913|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0092.wav|||Chief Rowley believed that they would,|
12914|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0093.wav|||because of Oswald's demonstrated hostility toward the Secretary of the Navy in his letter of January thirty, nineteen sixty-two. Quote,|
12915|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0094.wav|||I shall employ all means to right this gross mistake or injustice to a bona fide U.S. citizen and ex-service man.|
12916|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0095.wav|||The U.S. government has no charges or complaints against me.|
12917|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0096.wav|||I ask you to look into this case and take the necessary steps to repair the damage done to me and my family. End quote.|
12918|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0097.wav|||Even with the advantage of hindsight, this letter does not appear to express or imply Oswald's, quote,|
12919|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0098.wav|||determination to use a means, other than legal or peaceful, to satisfy his grievance, end quote, within the meaning of the new criteria.|
12920|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0099.wav|||It is apparent that a good deal of further consideration and experimentation will be required before adequate criteria can be framed.|
12921|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0100.wav|||The Commission recognizes that no set of meaningful criteria will yield the names of all potential assassins. Charles J. Guiteau,|
12922|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0101.wav|||Leon F. Czolgosz,|
12923|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0102.wav|||John Schrank, and Guiseppe Zangara -- four assassins or would-be assassins|
12924|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0103.wav|||were all men who acted alone in their criminal acts against our leaders. None had a serious record of prior violence.|
12925|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0104.wav|||Each of them was a failure in his work and in his relations with others, a victim of delusions and fancies which led to the conviction|
12926|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0105.wav|||that society and its leaders had combined to thwart him. It will require every available resource of our Government|
12927|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0106.wav|||to devise a practical system which has any reasonable possibility of revealing such malcontents.|
12928|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0107.wav|||Liaison with other agencies regarding intelligence.|
12929|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0108.wav|||The Secret Service's liaison with the agencies that supply information to it has been too casual.|
12930|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0109.wav|||Since the assassination, the Service has recognized that these relationships must be far more formal|
12931|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0110.wav|||and each agency given clear understanding of the assistance which the Secret Service expects.|
12932|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0111.wav|||Once the Secret Service has formulated its new standards for collection of information, it should enter into written agreements with each Federal agency|
12933|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0112.wav|||and the leading State and local agencies that might be a source of such information.|
12934|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0113.wav|||Such agreements should describe in detail the information which is sought, the manner in which it will be provided to the Secret Service,|
12935|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0114.wav|||and the respective responsibilities for any further investigation that may be required.|
12936|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0115.wav|||This is especially necessary with regard to the FBI and CIA,|
12937|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0116.wav|||which carry the major responsibility for supplying information about potential threats,|
12938|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0117.wav|||particularly those arising from organized groups, within their special jurisdiction.|
12939|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0118.wav|||Since these agencies are already obliged constantly to evaluate the activities of such groups,|
12940|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0119.wav|||they should be responsible for advising the Secret Service if information develops indicating the existence of an assassination plot|
12941|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0120.wav|||and for reporting such events as a change in leadership or dogma which indicate that the group may present a danger to the President.|
12942|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0121.wav|||Detailed formal agreements embodying these arrangements should be worked out between the Secret Service and both of these agencies.|
12943|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0122.wav|||It should be made clear that the Secret Service will in no way seek to duplicate the intelligence|
12944|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0123.wav|||and investigative capabilities of the agencies now operating in this field but will continue|
12945|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0124.wav|||to use the data developed by these agencies to carry out its special duties.|
12946|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0125.wav|||Once experience has been gained in implementing such agreements with the Federal and leading State and local agencies,|
12947|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0126.wav|||the Secret Service, through its field offices,|
12948|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0127.wav|||should negotiate similar arrangements with such other State and local law enforcement agencies as may provide meaningful assistance.|
12949|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0128.wav|||Much useful information will come to the attention of local law enforcement agencies in the regular course of their activities,|
12950|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0129.wav|||and this source should not be neglected by undue concentration on relationships with other Federal agencies.|
12951|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0130.wav|||Finally, these agreements with Federal and local authorities will be of little value|
12952|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0131.wav|||unless a system is established for the frequent formal review of activities thereunder. In this regard|
12953|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0132.wav|||the Commission notes with approval several recent measures taken and proposed by the Secret Service to improve its liaison arrangements.|
12954|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0133.wav|||In his testimony Secretary of the Treasury C. Douglas Dillon informed the Commission|
12955|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0134.wav|||that an interagency committee has been established to develop more effective criteria.|
12956|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0135.wav|||According to Secretary Dillon,|
12957|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0136.wav|||the Committee will include representatives of the President's Office of Science and Technology, Department of Defense, CIA,|
12958|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0137.wav|||FBI, and the Secret Service.|
12959|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0138.wav|||In addition, the Department of the Treasury has requested five additional agents for its Protective Research Section|
12960|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0139.wav|||to serve as liaison officers with law enforcement and intelligence agencies. On the basis of the Department's review during the past several months,|
12961|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0140.wav|||Secretary Dillon testified that the use of such liaison officers is the only effective way to insure that adequate liaison is maintained.|
12962|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0141.wav|||As a beginning step to improve liaison with local law enforcement officials, the Secret Service on August twenty-six, nineteen sixty-four,|
12963|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0142.wav|||directed its field representatives to send a form request for intelligence information to all local,|
12964|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0143.wav|||county, and State law enforcement agencies in their districts.|
12965|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0144.wav|||Each of these efforts appears sound,|
12966|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0145.wav|||and the Commission recommends that these and the other measures suggested by the Commission be pursued vigorously by Secret Service.|
12967|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0146.wav|||Automatic data processing|
12968|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0147.wav|||Unless the Secret Service is able to deal rapidly and accurately with a growing body of data,|
12969|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0148.wav|||the increased information supplied by other agencies will be wasted.|
12970|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0149.wav|||PRS must develop the capacity to classify its subjects on a more sophisticated basis than the present geographic breakdown.|
12971|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0150.wav|||Its present manual filing system is obsolete;|
12972|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0151.wav|||it makes no use of the recent developments in automatic data processing which are widely used in the business world and in other Government offices.|
12973|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0152.wav|||The Secret Service and the Department of the Treasury now recognize this critical need.|
12974|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0153.wav|||In the planning document currently under review by the Bureau of the Budget, the Department recommends that it be permitted to hire five qualified persons, quote,|
12975|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0154.wav|||to plan and develop a workable and efficient automated file and retrieval system, end quote.|
12976|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0155.wav|||Also the Department requests the sum of one hundred thousand dollars to conduct a detailed feasibility study;|
12977|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0156.wav|||this money would be used to compensate consultants, to lease standard equipment or to purchase specially designed pilot equipment.|
12978|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0157.wav|||On the basis of such a feasibility study,|
12979|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0158.wav|||the Department hopes to design a practical system which will fully meet the needs of the Protective Research Section of the Secret Service.|
12980|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0159.wav|||The Commission recommends that prompt and favorable consideration be given to this request.|
12981|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0160.wav|||The Commission further recommends that the Secret Service coordinate its planning as closely as possible with all of the Federal agencies from which it receives information.|
12982|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0161.wav|||The Secret Service should not and does not plan to develop its own intelligence gathering facilities to duplicate the existing facilities of other Federal agencies.|
12983|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0162.wav|||In planning its data processing techniques,|
12984|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0163.wav|||the Secret Service should attempt to develop a system compatible with those of the agencies from which most of its data will come. Note:|
12985|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0164.wav|||In evaluating data processing techniques of the Secret Service,|
12986|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0165.wav|||the Commission had occasion to become informed, to a limited extent, about the data processing techniques of other Federal intelligence and law enforcement agencies.|
12987|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0166.wav|||The Commission was struck by the apparent lack of effort, on an interagency basis,|
12988|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0167.wav|||to develop coordinated and mutually compatible systems, even where such coordination would not seem inconsistent|
12989|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0168.wav|||with the particular purposes of the agency involved. The Commission recognizes that this is a controversial area|
12990|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0169.wav|||and that many strongly held views are advanced in resistance to any suggestion that an effort be made to impose any degree of coordination.|
12991|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0170.wav|||This matter is obviously beyond the jurisdiction of the Commission,|
12992|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0171.wav|||but it seems to warrant further study before each agency becomes irrevocably committed to separate action.|
12993|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0172.wav|||The Commission, therefore, recommends that the President consider ordering an inquiry into the possibility|
12994|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0173.wav|||that coordination might be achieved to a greater extent than seems now to be contemplated, without interference with the primary mission of each agency involved.|
12995|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0174.wav|||Protective Research participation in advance arrangements.|
12996|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0175.wav|||Since the assassination, Secret Service procedures have been changed to require that a member of PRS accompany each advance survey team|
12997|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0176.wav|||to establish liaison with local intelligence gathering agencies and to provide for the immediate evaluation of information received from them.|
12998|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0177.wav|||This PRS agent will also be responsible for establishing an informal local liaison committee|
12999|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0178.wav|||to make certain that all protective intelligence activities are coordinated.|
13000|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0179.wav|||Based on its experience during this period, the Secret Service now recommends that additional personnel be made available to PRS|
13001|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0180.wav|||so that these arrangements can be made permanent without adversely affecting the operations of the Service's field offices.|
13002|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0181.wav|||The Commission regards this as a most useful innovation and urges that the practice be continued.|
13003|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0182.wav|||Liaison With Local Law Enforcement Agencies|
13004|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0183.wav|||Advice by the Secret Service to local police in metropolitan areas relating to the assistance expected in connection with a Presidential visit|
13005|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0184.wav|||has hitherto been handled on an informal basis.|
13006|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0185.wav|||The Service should consider preparing formal explanations of the cooperation anticipated during a Presidential visit to a city,|
13007|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0186.wav|||in formats that can be communicated to each level of local authorities.|
13008|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0187.wav|||Thus, the local chief of police could be given a master plan, prepared for the occasion, of all protective measures to be taken during the visit;|
13009|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0188.wav|||each patrolman might be given a prepared booklet of instructions explaining what is expected of him. The Secret Service has expressed concern|
13010|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0189.wav|||that written instructions might come into the hands of local newspapers, to the prejudice of the precautions described.|
13011|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0190.wav|||However, the instructions must be communicated to the local police in any event and can be leaked to the press whether or not they are in writing.|
13012|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0191.wav|||More importantly, the lack of carefully prepared and carefully transmitted instructions for typical visits to cities|
13013|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0192.wav|||can lead to lapses in protection, such as the confusion in Dallas about whether members of the public were permitted on overpasses.|
13014|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0193.wav|||Such instructions will not fit all circumstances, of course,|
13015|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0194.wav|||and should not be relied upon to the detriment of the imaginative application of judgment in special cases.|
13016|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0195.wav|||Inspection of Buildings|
13017|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0196.wav|||Since the assassination of President Kennedy, the Secret Service has been experimenting with new techniques in the inspection of buildings along a motorcade route.|
13018|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0197.wav|||According to Secretary Dillon,|
13019|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0198.wav|||the studies indicate that there is some utility in attempting to designate certain buildings as involving a higher risk than others.|
13020|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0199.wav|||The Commission strongly encourages these efforts to improve protection along a motorcade route.|
13021|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0200.wav|||The Secret Service should utilize the personnel of other Federal law enforcement offices|
13022|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0201.wav|||in the locality to assure adequate manpower for this task, as it is now doing.|
13023|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0202.wav|||Lack of adequate resources is an unacceptable excuse for failing to improve advance precautions|
13024|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0203.wav|||in this crucial area of Presidential protection.|
13025|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0204.wav|||Secret Service Personnel and Facilities|
13026|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0205.wav|||Testimony and other evidence before the Commission|
13027|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0206.wav|||suggest that the Secret Service is trying to accomplish its job with too few people and without adequate modern equipment.|
13028|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0207.wav|||Although Chief Rowley does not complain about the pay scale for Secret Service agents,|
13029|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0208.wav|||salaries are below those of the FBI and leading municipal police forces.|
13030|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0209.wav|||The assistant to the Director of the FBI testified that|
13031|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0210.wav|||the caseload of each FBI agent averaged twenty to twenty-five, and he felt that this was high.|
13032|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0211.wav|||Chief Rowley testified that the present workload of each Secret Service agent averages one hundred ten point one cases.|
13033|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0212.wav|||While these statistics relate to the activities of Secret Service agents stationed in field offices and not the White House detail,|
13034|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0213.wav|||field agents supplement those on the detail, particularly when the President is traveling.|
13035|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0214.wav|||Although the Commission does not know whether the cases involved are entirely comparable,|
13036|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0215.wav|||these figures suggest that the agents of the Secret Service are substantially overworked.|
13037|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0216.wav|||In its budget request for the fiscal year beginning July one, nineteen sixty-four,|
13038|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0217.wav|||the Secret Service sought funds for twenty-five new positions, primarily in field offices. This increase has been approved by the Congress.|
13039|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0218.wav|||Chief Rowley explained that this would not provide enough additional manpower to take all the measures which he considers required.|
13040|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0219.wav|||However, the nineteen sixty-four to sixty-five budget request was submitted in November nineteen sixty-three|
13041|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0220.wav|||and requests for additional personnel were not made because of the studies then being conducted.|
13042|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0221.wav|||The Secret Service has now presented its recommendations to the Bureau of the Budget. The plan proposed by the Service|
13043|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0222.wav|||would take approximately twenty months to implement and require expenditures of approximately three million dollars during that period.|
13044|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0223.wav|||The plan provides for an additional two hundred five agents for the Secret Service. Seventeen of this number are proposed for the Protective Research Section;|
13045|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0224.wav|||one hundred forty-five are proposed for the field offices to handle the increased volume of security investigations|
13046|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0225.wav|||and be available to protect the President or Vice President when they travel;|
13047|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0226.wav|||eighteen agents are proposed for a rotating pool which will go through an intensive training cycle and also be available to supplement the White House detail|
13048|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0227.wav|||in case of unexpected need; and twenty-five additional agents are recommended to provide the Vice President full protection.|
13049|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0228.wav|||The Commission urges that the Bureau of the Budget review these recommendations with the Secret Service and authorize a request for the necessary supplemental appropriation,|
13050|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0229.wav|||as soon as it can be justified. The Congress has often stressed that it will support any reasonable request for funds for the protection of the President.|
13051|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0230.wav|||Manpower and Technical Assistance From Other Agencies|
13052|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0231.wav|||Before the assassination the Secret Service infrequently requested other Federal law enforcement agencies to provide personnel|
13053|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0232.wav|||to assist in its protection functions.|
13054|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0233.wav|||Since the assassination, the Service has experimented with the use of agents borrowed for short periods from such agencies.|
13055|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0234.wav|||It has used other Treasury law enforcement agents on special experiments in building and route surveys in places to which the President frequently travels.|
13056|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0235.wav|||It has also used other Federal law enforcement agents during Presidential visits to cities in which such agents are stationed.|
13057|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0236.wav|||Thus, in the four months following the assassination,|
13058|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0237.wav|||the FBI, on sixteen separate occasions, supplied a total of one hundred thirty-nine agents to assist in protection work during a Presidential visit,|
13059|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0238.wav|||which represents a departure from its prior practice.|
13060|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0239.wav|||From February eleven through June thirty, nineteen sixty-four,|
13061|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0240.wav|||the Service had the advantage of nine thousand, five hundred hours of work by other enforcement agencies.|
13062|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0241.wav|||The FBI has indicated that it is willing to continue to make such assistance available,|
13063|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0242.wav|||even though it agrees with the Secret Service that it is preferable for the Service to have enough agents to handle all protective demands.|
13064|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0243.wav|||The Commission endorses these efforts to supplement the Service's own personnel by obtaining, for short periods of time,|
13065|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0244.wav|||the assistance of trained Federal law enforcement officers.|
13066|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0245.wav|||In view of the ever-increasing mobility of American Presidents, it seems unlikely that the Service could or should increase its own staff to a size|
13067|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0246.wav|||which would permit it to provide adequate protective manpower for all situations.|
13068|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0247.wav|||The Commission recommends that the agencies involved determine how much periodic assistance they can provide, and that each such agency|
13069|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0248.wav|||and the Secret Service enter into a formal agreement defining such arrangements.|
13070|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0249.wav|||It may eventually be desirable to codify the practice in an Executive order.|
13071|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0250.wav|||The Secret Service will be better able to plan its own long-range personnel requirements if it knows with reasonable certainty|
13072|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0251.wav|||the amount of assistance that it can expect from other agencies.|
13073|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0252.wav|||The occasional use of personnel from other Federal agencies to assist in protecting the President has a further advantage. It symbolizes the reality|
13074|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0253.wav|||that the job of protecting the President has not been and cannot be exclusively the responsibility of the Secret Service.|
13075|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0254.wav|||The Secret Service in the past has sometimes guarded its right to be acknowledged as the sole protector of the Chief Executive.|
13076|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0255.wav|||This no longer appears to be the case.|
13077|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0256.wav|||Protecting the President is a difficult and complex task which requires full use of the best resources of many parts of our Government.|
13078|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0257.wav|||Recognition that the responsibility must be shared increases the likelihood that it will be met.|
13079|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0258.wav|||Much of the Secret Service work requires the development and use of highly sophisticated equipment,|
13080|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0259.wav|||some of which must be specially designed to fit unique requirements. Even before the assassination, and to a far greater extent thereafter,|
13081|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0260.wav|||the Secret Service has been receiving full cooperation in scientific research and technological development|
13082|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0261.wav|||from many Government agencies including the Department of Defense and the President's Office of Science and Technology.|
13083|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0262.wav|||Even if the manpower and technological resources of the Secret Service are adequately augmented,|
13084|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0263.wav|||it will continue to rely in many respects upon the greater resources of the Office of Science and Technology and other agencies.|
13085|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0264.wav|||The Commission recommends that the present arrangements|
13086|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0265.wav|||with the Office of Science and Technology and the other Federal agencies that have been so helpful to the Secret Service be placed on a permanent and formal basis.|
13087|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0266.wav|||The exchange of letters dated August thirty-one, nineteen sixty-four,|
13088|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0267.wav|||between Secretary Dillon and Donald F. Hornig, Special Assistant to the President for Science and Technology, is a useful effort in the right direction.|
13089|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0268.wav|||The Service should negotiate a memorandum of understanding with each agency that has been assisting it and from which it can expect to need help in the future.|
13090|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0269.wav|||The essential terms of such memoranda might well be embodied in an Executive order.|
13091|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0270.wav|||This Commission can recommend no procedures for the future protection of our Presidents which will guarantee security.|
13092|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0271.wav|||The demands on the President in the execution of His responsibilities in today's world are so varied and complex|
13093|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0272.wav|||and the traditions of the office in a democracy such as ours are so deep-seated as to preclude absolute security.|
13094|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0273.wav|||The Commission has, however, from its examination of the facts of President Kennedy's assassination|
13095|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0274.wav|||made certain recommendations which it believes would, if adopted,|
13096|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0275.wav|||materially improve upon the procedures in effect at the time of President Kennedy's assassination and result in a substantial lessening of the danger.|
13097|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0276.wav|||As has been pointed out, the Commission has not resolved all the proposals which could be made. The Commission nevertheless is confident that,|
13098|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0277.wav|||with the active cooperation of the responsible agencies and with the understanding of the people of the United States in their demands upon their President,|
13099|english|english|LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0278.wav|||the recommendations we have here suggested would greatly advance the security of the office without any impairment of our fundamental liberties.|
